# 	Preparation Exam: Certified Developer - Associate for AWS
1. You are a cloud engineer working for a financial services group and you support several applications hosted on AWS. Your applications are heavily trafficked during the end-of-quarter processing window. One of your application teams reports poor performance and they believe the issue to be related to application scaling. You log in to the AWS CLI and retrieve the error message, which indicates an AMI-related issue. What possible workarounds could you attempt to resolve this issue? (Choose 3 answers)

A: The AMI that you requested cannot be found. Create a new AMI and update the Auto Scaling group.

B : The AMI requested by the Auto Scaling group is already running. Disregard the error.

C : The AMI is in a pending state (either newly deployed or busy). Wait until the AMI is ready and update the Auto Scaling group.

D: The value provided for the AMI is invalid. Provide the correct AMI ID and retry.

2. An error has occurred in your company’s application and you are trying to retrace what happened. You come across this entry in the company’s CloudTrail logs. What events have happened, according to this log entry? (Choose 2 answers)

Your company, which uses multiple Amazon VPCs, is setting up a new office and is deciding what is the most suitable way to connect this new remote office network with the company’s Amazon VPC environment. Since it’s a new office, no VPN equipment or internet connections yet exist so this office is free to use whatever connection design pattern it chooses. The highest priorities are predictable network performance and reduced bandwidth costs. You would also prefer not to be responsible for ensuring the high availability solutions for all VPN endpoints. Which network design pattern to connect to the Amazon VPC environment would make the most sense in this given scenario?


A
Establish a hub-and-spoke model for connecting your new office using AWS VPN CloudHub.

B
Establish a hardware VPN connection from your new office’s network to the AWS-managed network equipment attached to your Amazon VPC.

C
Establish a private connection from your new office’s network to your Amazon VPC using AWS Direct Connect.

D
Establish a VPN connection from your new office’s equipment to your software VPN appliance running inside one of your Amazon VPCs.

aws dynamodb update-item \ table-name ProductCatalog \ key '{"Id":{"N":"789"}}' \ update-expression "SET Price = if_not_exists(Price, :p)" \ expression-attribute-values '{":p": {"N": "100"}}' \ return-values ALL_NEW

aws dynamodb update-item \ table-name ProductCatalog \ key '{"Id":{"N":"789"}}' \ update-expression "SET Price = :p)" \ expression-attribute-values '{":p": {"N": "100"}}' \ return-values ALL_NEW

C
aws dynamodb update-item \ table-name ProductCatalog \ key '{"Id":{"N":"789"}}' \ update-expression "ADD if_not_exists(Price, :p)" \ expression-attribute-values '{":p": {"N": "100"}}' \ return-values ALL_NEW

D
aws dynamodb add-item \ table-name ProductCatalog \ key '{"Id":{"N":"789"}}' \ update-expression "ADD Price = :p" \ expression-attribute-values '{":p": {"N": "100"}}' \ return-values ALL_NEW
